Common mistakes I hear often:
“You cannot plan for everything.” – Principle: web development is FINITE. There is a set of finite events that can happen when a user interacts with a webpage. There can be a finite set of browsers and devices we fully support and so on (like NOW but yes future can change this and break this idea). 

“That won’t affect very many users.”

“Most users will not do that” – always be sure to solve for the LEAST experienced user of all levels of accessibility.

Not to always plan for “scale” unless you only have a small and very limited # of users.

Not resuing stuff and buidling every things as a pattern that is resuable in 98% of cases :)
