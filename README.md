 DevSecOPs journal 


JIRA ticket MIAN GOAL - is to provide a central hub of info for what work is to be done and what is DONE and what is success. The busines susually has some ivory tower nah man you are dev do what I say we don’t need to expalin our reasoins. 

CODE - serves users -- bsuiness GAIN such and such

Who is the END consumer ?
 why value 

Why is it my job to flush out a ticket fully
My job is to write code or be the interpreter of tickets maybe that is my job 
Cross funtoinal teams effectiveness 
Each person wants createive wiggle room and not feel like a robot 

why wold they NOT fully flush it out ? is that not their job - they disagree its their job and or they dont have the skill or time or both to do that. ?
why would they not equally be touchign bases with the DEVE while writing hte ticket to show in depth diers to know just aliek a dev owudl reach out to know his side..
?
And not feel micro managed 
see bottom comments 
 
Ticket language TIPs:
Work with FA for how to make it universal for business and developer. Shoot for a balance precision, concise, simplicity and technical jargon.
 
What is "Done"? Or acceptance criteria 
See here https://www.productplan.com/glossary/acceptance-criteria/  Are the Acceptance Criteria testable?
If so, what aspect of (automated) tests can be done by devs and what part by Quality Assurance for example. 
 
OPTIONAL- ICS Principles Check [mainly ask just ONE or more of the principles and communication guide stuff]:
Is this solution simple? Is there reason to being up something seemingly out of alignment.

RASCI [who can make decisions for what aspects or contact for who to turn for help]:
Change Process: If anything above changes do this…. Who notates?  What type of things are REQURIED to be notated?

*-there is something to be said for level of sophistication of the required solution. User expectations are important to manage so there can be something noted if not covered as to maybe future enhancement. This preplanning will prevent needless questions that always surely can come from each developers experience as to how something "should behave."
